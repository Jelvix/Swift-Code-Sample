# Swift Code Sample

This project was created in order to show programming skills of iOS developers from Jelvix.

Task: Using the Tinder API (https://gist.github.com/rtt/10403467) we had to create Sign In screen into Tinder using Facebook and the additional screen that will show people whose location is nearby the user. Also, we had to implement like/dislike feature into the system.


### AUTHENTICATING:
You need to provide Tinder FacebookAppID in the info.plist file for the successfull authorization to the application.
